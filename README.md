# Public code for the OOSA course.

There is a separate directory for each week's work. As we progress, suggested answers will be uploaded.

## Foundations

The **foundations** folder contains some warm up exercises to transition on to the course. There are two folders within:

* basic\_features
* iterating

The **basic\_features** folder contains a set of scripts introducing the basic Python features (data types, loops, plotting etc.). Other than **06_objects.py**, which will be covered in week 2, these should already be familar to you and are included here for revision.

The **iterating** directory contains some exercises to practice using loops and work up to movoing around a raster dataset.


## Week 1

Week 1 covers:

***Aspects***
* Github version control and code repository
* Computer basics 
* Revision of loops and file I/O

***Algorithm***
* Introduction to algorithm design: Finding minima and sorting

Material will be added as we progress through the class.


### fileIO

Contains two scripts to demonstrate reading from a text file and writing to a text file. The ***data*** folder contains the data for the file reading example.


## Week 2

This week covers

***Aspects***
* Using the command line to make programmable programs
* Objects and classes

***Algorithm***
* Binary search: Loop and recursion

### command\_line

Contains two files. *commandExample.py* is a minimum workable example for a command line interface. *commandLineIllus.py* shows an example of most of the common options you might want to add to a command line, in terms of the data types read.

### main

Contains *mainTest.py* to give an example of defining the main block.

### data

Contains an ASCII data file to use if needed.

### objects

Contains an example of an object to show how attributes (data) and methods (functions) can be combined within an object.
